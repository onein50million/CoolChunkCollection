#===================
# Generated by Cargo
# will have compiled files and executables

# Remove Cargo.lock from gitignore if creating an executable, leave it for libraries
# More information here https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html
Cargo.lock

# These are backup files generated by rustfmt

# MSVC Windows builds of rustc generate these, which store debugging information
*.pdb
